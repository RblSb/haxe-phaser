/**
	The Mobile Pipeline is the core 2D texture rendering pipeline used by Phaser in WebGL
	when the device running the game is detected to be a mobile.
	
	You can control the use of this pipeline by setting the Game Configuration
	property `autoMobilePipeline`. If set to `false` then all devices will use
	the Multi Tint Pipeline. You can also call the `PipelineManager.setDefaultPipeline`
	method at run-time, rather than boot-time, to modify the default Game Object
	pipeline.
	
	Virtually all Game Objects use this pipeline by default, including Sprites, Graphics
	and Tilemaps. It handles the batching of quads and tris, as well as methods for
	drawing and batching geometry data.
	
	The fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Mobile.frag`.
	The vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Mobile.vert`.
	
	The default shader attributes for this pipeline are:
	
	`inPosition` (vec2, offset 0)
	`inTexCoord` (vec2, offset 8)
	`inTexId` (float, offset 16)
	`inTintEffect` (float, offset 20)
	`inTint` (vec4, offset 24, normalized)
	
	Note that `inTexId` isn't used in the shader, it's just kept to allow us
	to piggy-back on the Multi Tint Pipeline functions.
	
	The default shader uniforms for this pipeline are:
	
	`uProjectionMatrix` (mat4)
	`uRoundPixels` (int)
	`uResolution` (vec2)
	`uMainSampler` (sampler2D, or sampler2D array)
