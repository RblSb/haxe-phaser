/**
	The Gradient FX Pipeline.
	
	The gradient overlay effect is a visual technique where a smooth color transition is applied over Game Objects,
	such as sprites or UI components. This effect is used to enhance visual appeal, emphasize depth, or create
	stylistic and atmospheric variations. It can also be utilized to convey information, such as representing
	progress or health status through color changes.
	
	A Gradient effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addGradient();
	```
