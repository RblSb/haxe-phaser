/**
	The Displacement FX Pipeline.
	
	The displacement effect is a visual technique that alters the position of pixels in an image
	or texture based on the values of a displacement map. This effect is used to create the illusion
	of depth, surface irregularities, or distortion in otherwise flat elements. It can be applied to
	characters, objects, or backgrounds to enhance realism, convey movement, or achieve various
	stylistic appearances.
	
	A Displacement effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addDisplacement();
	```
