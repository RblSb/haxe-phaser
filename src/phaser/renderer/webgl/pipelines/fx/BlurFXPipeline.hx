/**
	The Blur FX Pipeline.
	
	A Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect,
	typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a
	smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different
	from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination.
	
	A Blur effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addBlur();
	```
