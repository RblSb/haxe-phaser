/**
	The Shine FX Pipeline.
	
	The shine effect is a visual technique that simulates the appearance of reflective
	or glossy surfaces by passing a light beam across a Game Object. This effect is used to
	enhance visual appeal, emphasize certain features, and create a sense of depth or
	material properties.
	
	A Shine effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addShine();
	```
