/**
	The Wipe FX Pipeline.
	
	The wipe or reveal effect is a visual technique that gradually uncovers or conceals elements
	in the game, such as images, text, or scene transitions. This effect is often used to create
	a sense of progression, reveal hidden content, or provide a smooth and visually appealing transition
	between game states.
	
	You can set both the direction and the axis of the wipe effect. The following combinations are possible:
	
	* left to right: direction 0, axis 0
	* right to left: direction 1, axis 0
	* top to bottom: direction 1, axis 1
	* bottom to top: direction 1, axis 0
	
	It is up to you to set the `progress` value yourself, i.e. via a Tween, in order to transition the effect.
	
	A Wipe effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addWipe();
	sprite.postFX.addReveal();
	```
