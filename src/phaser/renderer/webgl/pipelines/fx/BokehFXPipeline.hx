/**
	The Bokeh FX Pipeline.
	
	Bokeh refers to a visual effect that mimics the photographic technique of creating a shallow depth of field.
	This effect is used to emphasize the game's main subject or action, by blurring the background or foreground
	elements, resulting in a more immersive and visually appealing experience. It is achieved through rendering
	techniques that simulate the out-of-focus areas, giving a sense of depth and realism to the game's graphics.
	
	This effect can also be used to generate a Tilt Shift effect, which is a technique used to create a miniature
	effect by blurring everything except a small area of the image. This effect is achieved by blurring the
	top and bottom elements, while keeping the center area in focus.
	
	A Bokeh effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addBokeh();
	```
