/**
	The Circle FX Pipeline.
	
	This effect will draw a circle around the texture of the Game Object, effectively masking off
	any area outside of the circle without the need for an actual mask. You can control the thickness
	of the circle, the color of the circle and the color of the background, should the texture be
	transparent. You can also control the feathering applied to the circle, allowing for a harsh or soft edge.
	
	Please note that adding this effect to a Game Object will not change the input area or physics body of
	the Game Object, should it have one.
	
	A Circle effect is added to a Game Object via the FX component:
	
	```js
	const sprite = this.add.sprite();
	
	sprite.postFX.addCircle();
	```
