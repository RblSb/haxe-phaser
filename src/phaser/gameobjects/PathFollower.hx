	A PathFollower Game Object.

	Anything you can do with a standard Sprite can be done with this PathFollower, such as animate it, tint it,
	scale it and so on.
	
	PathFollowers are bound to a single Path at any one time and can traverse the length of the Path, from start
	to finish, forwards or backwards, or from any given point on the Path to its end. They can optionally rotate
	to face the direction of the path, be offset from the path coordinates or rotate independently of the Path.

		To get a value back again you can call `getData`:

		If the key already exists, a `changedata` event is emitted instead, along an event named after the key.
		For example, if you updated an existing key called `PlayerLives` then it would emit the event `changedata-PlayerLives`.
		These events will be emitted regardless if you use this method to set the value, or the direct `values` setter.
		
		Please note that the data keys are case-sensitive and must be valid JavaScript Object property strings.
