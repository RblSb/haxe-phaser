template for haxe-phaser

run the build by "haxe build.hxml"
then run a local server such as "http-server" or run the live server in vscode

for the live server to reflect changes remember to re-run the build command 

for offline use 

download the phaser files from the phaser repository 
"https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser"
and add them into your working directory and denote the include line in the build.hxml

Special thanks to 

github.com/sebbernery

for the template
